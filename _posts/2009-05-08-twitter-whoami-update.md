![Greasemonkey]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/tweetMonkey.jpg "Twitter - Greasemonkey")

Twitter recently changed the ids and classes that they use for the DIVs their pages, so I had to make an update to the [Twitter WhoAmi script](/home/javascript/2009/02/15/augmenting-twitter-whoami.html).

Still find it useful as I now have at least 4 Twitter identities (one personal and three project IDs).
