[nerdnite Austin](http://austin.nerdnite.com/) has just announced the line up for the May edition of nerdnite.

As the co-founder of nerdnite Austin, I have to admit a little bias, but I think you should head on over and check it out! This month we're talking about accidental innovation and smart environments.

If you're interested in presenting at nerdnite, you can use the contact form on the site or sign up to the mailing list and indicate your preference then.
