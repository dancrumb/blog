So, it's been over a month since I last posted, but things have got busy. Here's what I've been up to:

*   [preDevCamp](http://predevcamp.org) has bloomed! We're still waiting on Palm/Sprint to announce a launch date, but I did get my hands on a copy of the SDK and am looking forward to playing with it.
*   I got involved in an organization called Linux Against Poverty. That's all I'm saying for now, but watch this space for more details
*   I launched nerdnite Austin with JC. I also revamped the [nerdnite](http://nerdnite.com) website which went live last weekend.
*   I'm moving house. Closing this Monday. Yikes!

Consider this my return post. I'll be posting more often once things have been sorted with the house... see you soon!

_(Thanks to my sister for the prodding!)_

I have spent a fair amount of time setting up the hosting for my sister's site: [http://purplestarconsulting.com](http://purplestarconsulting.com). If you're an Atlanta based small business and need assistance with marketing and web presence, go check her out!
