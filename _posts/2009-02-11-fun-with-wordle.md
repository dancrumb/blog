IBM Research have come up with a nice little toy called [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net/gallery/wrdl/530613/dancrumb_blog "Wordle: dancrumb blog"). You provide it with the URL of a blog or RSS feed and it generates a tag cloud, with the size of the words representing their prominence. Once the cloud has been generated, you're free to tweak the word orientation and the colour scheme.

The cloud above represents my blog as of February 11 2009\. Some others that may interest you:
