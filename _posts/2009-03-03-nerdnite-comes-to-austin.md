Thanks to [Michelle Greer](http://blogs.discovery.com/nerdabout_austin/2009/03/nerdnite-austin-needs-you.html) for announcing the arrival of NerdNite in Austin.

NerdNite is like the Discovery Channel with beer. JC Dwyer and I are bringing NerdNite from Boston and New York to Austin. Starting March 26th, we plan to host a NerdNite on the last Thursday of every month at Opal Divine's. You can email us at austin(at)nerdnite.com for more information or if you'd like to present one month.

We welcome all-comers. As far was we're concerned, a nerd is just a person with a fascination for a topic, not normally shared by others. At NerdNite, you can share with the group thanks to the gentle lubricating power of beer!
