I'm in Long Beach this weekend, attending the [BIL Conference](http://bilconference.com/). BIL is an open, self-organizing, emergent, arts, science, society and technology conference. Anyone can come; anyone can speak. If you have an idea to spread, start talking. If someone is saying something interesting, stop and listen.

BIL takes place next to [TED](http://ted.com), which is a high powered annual conference, bringing together luminaries of Technology, Entertainment and Design. The ethos of BIL is that you don't need to be a luminary to have a great idea.

It remains to be seen quite how effective BIL is. The people I've met so far have been a great bunch. I'll be blogging about this for the next couple of days, so watch this space.
