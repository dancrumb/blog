On Monday, I [announced the launch of preDevCamp](/?p=52 "preDevCamp Launches!"). There has been a fantastic global response and today I'd like to announce [the fanclub that we've set up on Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/pages/PreDevCamp/46844088654 "preDevCamp Facebook Fanclub").

Palm are taking some real interest in this camp and a Facebook fanclub is a great way to demonstrate the level of interest. Please show some support for preDevCamp by signing up.

While you're at it, swing over to [<del datetime="2012-12-11T03:45:39+00:00">http://predevcamp.org<</del>/a> and sign up to one of the events. Coding the Palm Pre is going to be a dream if you have any experience with developing with AJAX, so get involved! If there isn't an event in your city, let us know and we'll guide you through the process of setting one up.](http://predevcamp.org "This link is now defunct")
