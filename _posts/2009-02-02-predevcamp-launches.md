![]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/smartphonewarsfeb.jpg "Palm pre")

Today, [@whurley](http://twitter.com/whurley), [@giovanni](http://twitter.com/giovanni) and [I](http://twitter.com/dancrumb) launched the Palm [preDevCamp](http://predevcamp.org/).

For those of you not familiar with what a DevCamp is, it's an event to develop applications (local and web based) for the Palm Pre using the Mojo development SDK. They're open to all-comers and we're really looking forward to getting our hands on this new platform and coding some apps.

Take a look at the preDevCamp site. If your home city is not there, just get in touch with @giovanni and, Hey Presto!, you can lead the first local camp!
